# Exam of "laboratorio di informatica umanistica avanzata" of the 8th June 
### This repository is dedicated to the project presented for the exam of "Laboratorio avanzato di informatica umanistica" of the 8th of June 2022
The exam will be dedicated on the analysis of the tweets, that, as main topic, have "mental health". This thematic is really important to me, so I decided to focus on it. 
The project, called **Analysis of Mental Health's Tweets**, will be divide in several parts 
- Web Scraping, in order to automatically download data from Twitter to create Datsets for the analysis
- Sentiment Analysis of the tweets, to understand the basic emotions of them
- Networks, in order to visualize graphically the relations between the tweets
